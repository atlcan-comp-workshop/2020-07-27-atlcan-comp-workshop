  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is primarily aimed at analysts who are familiar with ATLAS software and git, and would like to learn the tools and steps involved with preserving their ATLAS analysis using the RECAST framework. No prior familiarity with docker or RECAST is required, but participants are asked to have docker installed on their laptop beforehand to save time during the tutorial (see instructions <a href="#DockerOS">below</a>).
